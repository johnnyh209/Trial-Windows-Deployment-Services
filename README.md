# Trial-Windows-Deployment-Services
My first attempt at using Windows Deployment Services (WDS).

All of this is done in virtual machines. I have opted to use Hyper-V as the hypervisor, along with VMs of Windows Server and Windows 10.

Goal is to set up WDS on an install of Windows Server, and spin up a second VM that downloads an image of Windows 10 using PXE boot.
